Update to new systems
- Fix rename for variables and functions.
- Declaration provider hover.

New features
- Strict on the status of empty structs.

- Inline structs.

- Fix tmlanguage for new with generics.

- Differentiate blocks and inline struct declarations in the contexts where either is excepted. '() => {}'
  This will result in a true ambiguity for empty blocks and empty structs.
  Workaround is to do '({...})' for struct values.

Bug fixes
- An inferred lambda in an unexpected position will cause a NRE. This is because ExpectingLambda is null.

Code health
- Move stuff to Parse/Workshop/ToWorkshop.

Code health (cosmetic)
- Rename ITypeOperator and similar to IBinaryOperator.
- Make provider/instance naming patterns consistent for types, functions, and variables.
